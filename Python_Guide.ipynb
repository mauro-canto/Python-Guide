You can define a class attribute by assigning a value to a variable name outside \"__init__()\", for example \"species = 'Canis'\". When an instance of the class is created, class attributes are automatically created and assigned to their initial values.

    "The bolinger bands were developed by John Bolinger. They are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average. The volatility of a financial assets is based on the standard deviation of its development. The bands will widen when volatility increases and will narrow when volatility decreases (more stable asset). Bollinger bands can be used to identify tops and bottoms and the strength of the actual trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "As bollinger bands are based on the volatility they reflect better the variation than the mean. Generally relatively high prices are considered when they are above the upper Bollinger band and relatively low prices when they are below the lower Bollinger band, nevertheless Bollinger bands are not a standalone tool and further indicators should be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to popular belief, Bollinger bands cannot be used to make reliable predictions based on how close or far will the price of the asset be with respect to their mean. This is because the price of an asset is not driven by any statistical distribution function known. Calculating the bands with 2 times the standard deviation does not ensure that 95% of closing prices will be inside the bands, that would require that prices follow a Gaussian distribution, which does not happen in reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless Bollinger bands are very useful analysing the price of an asset and because of the Chebyshev inequality they contain at least 75% of the prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should not give a special meaning when a price reaches upper or lower band, this cases should be analyzed together with other factors and metrics, nevertheless the interpretation that of a price reaching a band was so popular that some investment funds use them to take their positions and by doing so they are driving the market and giving meaning to this kind of events that in any other way would not occur.\n",
