This project contains a Jupyter Notebook intended to work as a Python master dictionary were to look for information regarding functionalities, libraries commands and utilities.

It is not indeed to work as a substitute to full documentation for all the libraries and commands but as a first consulting point. Links for full documentation on libraries are always provided for the user to expand their knowledge or dive deep on subjects and utilities not covered.
